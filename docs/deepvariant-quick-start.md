# DeepVariant quick start

This is an explanation of how to use DeepVariant.

## Background

To get started, you'll need the DeepVariant programs (and some packages they
depend on), some test data, and of course a place to run them.

We've provided a docker image, and some test data in a bucket on Google Cloud
Storage. The instructions below show how to download those using the `gsutil`
command, which you can get by installing the
[Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads).

Warning: there is an Ubuntu package with the same name, but it is a different
thing!

### Update since r0.7 : using docker instead of copying binaries.

Starting from the 0.7 release, we use docker to run the binaries instead of
copying binaries to local machines first. You can still read about the previous
approach in
[the Quick Start in r0.6](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.6/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md).
We recognize that there might be some overhead of using docker run. But using
docker makes this case study easier to generalize to different versions of Linux
systems. For example, we have verified that you can use docker to run
DeepVariant on other Linux systems such as CentOS 7.

If you want to compile the DeepVariant binaries for yourself (from the source
distribution on github) and run with your own data, that's fine too. Just
replace the steps in this document that fetch those things. The binaries we ship
are not compiled with aggressive optimizations, so they can run on more
platforms, so it may be worth tuning those flags for your hardware.

A Cloud platform can provide a convenient place to run, with both CPU, GPU, or
TPU support, if you don't have an available Linux machine of your own. We find
it handy to do these sort of exercises in that way, since DeepVariant requires a
number of extra system packages to be installed.

We made some notes about [Google Cloud Platform](deepvariant-gcp-info.md) which
might be useful.

## Get docker image, models, and test data

Before you start running, you need to have the following input files:

1.  A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)
    format and its corresponding index file (.fai). We'll refer to this as
    `${REF}` below.

1.  An aligned reads file in [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) format
    and its corresponding index file (.bai). We'll refer to this as `${BAM}`
    below. You get this by aligning the reads from a sequencing instrument,
    using an aligner like
    [BWA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/14/1754/225615/Fast-and-accurate-short-read-alignment-with)
    for example.

1.  A model checkpoint for DeepVariant. We'll refer to this as `${MODEL}` below.

```bash
BUCKET="gs://deepvariant"
BIN_VERSION="0.7.0"
MODEL_VERSION="0.7.0"

MODEL_NAME="DeepVariant-inception_v3-${MODEL_VERSION}+data-wgs_standard"
MODEL_BUCKET="${BUCKET}/models/DeepVariant/${MODEL_VERSION}/${MODEL_NAME}"
DATA_BUCKET="${BUCKET}/quickstart-testdata"

<<<<<<< HEAD
mkdir -p bin
# Download the DeepVariant binaries.
gsutil -m cp -P "${BIN_BUCKET}/*" bin/
```

Which should copy files into the bin subdirectory:

```bash
ls -1 bin/
```

producing

```
call_variants.zip
licenses.zip
make_examples.zip
model_eval.zip
model_train.zip
postprocess_variants.zip
run-prereq.sh
settings.sh
```

Install the prerequisites onto the machine:

```bash
cd bin; bash run-prereq.sh; cd -
||||||| merged common ancestors
mkdir -p bin
# Download the DeepVariant binaries.
gsutil -m cp "${BIN_BUCKET}/*" bin/
```

Which should copy files into the bin subdirectory:

```bash
ls -1 bin/
```

producing

```
call_variants.zip
licenses.zip
make_examples.zip
model_eval.zip
model_train.zip
postprocess_variants.zip
run-prereq.sh
settings.sh
```

Install the prerequisites onto the machine:

```bash
cd bin; bash run-prereq.sh; cd -
=======
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt-get -y install docker.io
sudo docker pull gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:"${BIN_VERSION}"
>>>>>>> 3c43de4541c45673e30d14daef742fca68fdf69b
```

### Download a model

Models file are stored in a shared Cloud Storage bucket:

`gs://deepvariant/models`

In this bucket models are organized into subdirectories by program name and
version, such as for the model to run on whole genome sequencing data:

```
DeepVariant/0.7.0/DeepVariant-inception_v3-0.7.0+data-wgs_standard/
```

and for the model to run on whole exome sequencing data.

```
DeepVariant/0.7.0/DeepVariant-inception_v3-0.7.0+data-wes_standard/
```

The model files are tagged with the program name and version, model name and the
data used to train the model. The CL number (google's code commit identifier)
may be safely ignored.

IMPORTANT: Models are tied to specific software versions. For example, you can
use model version 0.2.\* with any software version 0.2.\*. We recommend using
the latest software and the latest model.

Once you've selected an appropriate model directory, you can download it with
the [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) command. The path
to these model checkpoint files can then be provided to `call_variants`.

For example, let's download from the repository:

```bash
gsutil cp -R "${MODEL_BUCKET}" .
```

This should create a subdirectory in the current directory containing three
files:

```bash
ls -1 "${MODEL_NAME}/"
```

producing:

```
model.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001
model.ckpt.index
model.ckpt.meta
```

These files are in the standard [TensorFlow checkpoint
format](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables#checkpoint_files).

### Download test data

We've prepared a small test data bundle for use in this quick start guide that
can be downloaded to your instance with the
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) command.

Download the test bundle:

```bash
gsutil cp -R "${DATA_BUCKET}" .
```

This should create a subdirectory in the current directory containing the actual
data files:

```bash
ls -1 quickstart-testdata/
```

outputting:

```
NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam
NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.bai
test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.bed
test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz
test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz.tbi
ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta
ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.fai
ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz
ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz.fai
ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta.gz.gzi
```

## Run the pipeline

DeepVariant consists of 3 main binaries: `make_examples`, `call_variants`, and
`postprocess_variants`. For this quick start guide we'll store the output in a
new directory on the instance and set up variables to refer to the test data we
downloaded above:

```bash
OUTPUT_DIR=/home/${USER}/quickstart-output
mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_DIR}"
REF=/home/${USER}/quickstart-testdata/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta
BAM=/home/${USER}/quickstart-testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam
MODEL="/home/${USER}/${MODEL_NAME}/model.ckpt"
```

### `make_examples`

`make_examples` is the command used to extract pileup images from your BAM
files, encoding each as `tf.Example` (a kind of protocol buffer that TensorFlow
knows about) in "tfrecord" files. This tool is used as the first step of both
training and inference pipelines.

Here is an example command that would be used in inference (variant "calling")
mode:

```bash
sudo docker run \
  -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \
  gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:"${BIN_VERSION}" \
  /opt/deepvariant/bin/make_examples \
  --mode calling   \
  --ref "${REF}"   \
  --reads "${BAM}" \
  --regions "chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000" \
  --examples "${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord.gz"
```

If your machine has multiple cores, you can utilize them by running multiple
`make_examples` using the `--task` flag, which helps you split the input and
generates *sharded output*. Here is an example:

First install the GNU `parallel` tool to allow running multiple processes.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install parallel
```

```bash
LOGDIR=/home/${USER}/logs
N_SHARDS=3

mkdir -p "${LOGDIR}"
time seq 0 $((N_SHARDS-1)) | \
  parallel --eta --halt 2 --joblog "${LOGDIR}/log" --res "${LOGDIR}" \
  sudo docker run \
    -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \
    gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:"${BIN_VERSION}" \
    /opt/deepvariant/bin/make_examples \
    --mode calling \
    --ref "${REF}" \
    --reads "${BAM}" \
    --examples "${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord@${N_SHARDS}.gz" \
    --regions '"chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000"' \
    --task {}
```

To explain what *sharded output* is, for example, if `N_SHARDS` is 3, you'll get
three output files from the above command:

```
${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord-00000-of-00003.gz
${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord-00001-of-00003.gz
${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord-00002-of-00003.gz
```

In this example command above, we also used the `--regions
'"chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000"'` flag, which means we'll only process 10
kilobases of chromosome 20.

### `call_variants`

Once we have constructed the pileup images as "examples", we can then invoke the
variant calling tool to perform inference---identifying and labeling genomic
variants. We need to tell the `call_variants` command where to find the trained
machine learning model, using the `--checkpoint` argument.

Example command:

```bash
CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT="${OUTPUT_DIR}/call_variants_output.tfrecord.gz"

sudo docker run \
  -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \
  gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:"${BIN_VERSION}" \
  /opt/deepvariant/bin/call_variants \
 --outfile "${CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT}" \
 --examples "${OUTPUT_DIR}/examples.tfrecord@${N_SHARDS}.gz" \
 --checkpoint "${MODEL}"
```

Notice that the output of this command is another "tfrecord.gz" file---this,
again, is serialized protocol buffer data.

### `postprocess_variants`

To convert the tfrecord output of `call_variants` into the
[VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf) format that is familiar
to bioinformaticists, we need to invoke the `postprocess_variants` tool.

An example command is below. Note that the output file should end with either
`.vcf` or `.vcf.gz`.

```bash
FINAL_OUTPUT_VCF="${OUTPUT_DIR}/output.vcf.gz"

sudo docker run \
  -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \
  gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:"${BIN_VERSION}" \
  /opt/deepvariant/bin/postprocess_variants \
  --ref "${REF}" \
  --infile "${CALL_VARIANTS_OUTPUT}" \
  --outfile "${FINAL_OUTPUT_VCF}"
```

## Evaluating the results

Here we use the `hap.py`
([https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py))
program from Illumina to evaluate the resulting 10 kilobase vcf file. This
serves as a quick check to ensure the three DeepVariant commands ran correctly.

```bash
sudo docker pull pkrusche/hap.py
sudo docker run -it -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \
  pkrusche/hap.py /opt/hap.py/bin/hap.py \
  /home/${USER}/quickstart-testdata/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.vcf.gz \
  "${FINAL_OUTPUT_VCF}" \
  -f /home/${USER}/quickstart-testdata/test_nist.b37_chr20_100kbp_at_10mb.bed \
  -r "${REF}" \
  -o "${OUTPUT_DIR}/happy.output" \
  --engine=vcfeval \
  -l chr20:10000000-10010000
```

You should see output similar to the following.
